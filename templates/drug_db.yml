# Drug Information
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# maximum_parasite_killing_rate: 
#   e.g. 0.999 means the drug can kill 99.9% of parasites in 1 day if a person has 
#   the highest possible drug concentration
#
# n: 
#   the slope of the linear portion of the concentration-effect curve
#
# EC50: 
#   the drug concentration which produces 50% of the parasite killing achieved at maximum-concentration
#   ( the expected starting concentration is 1.0 )
#
# age_specific_drug_concentration_sd: 
#   the actual drug concentration, per individual, will be drawn from a normal distribution with mean=1 and this sd.
#
# k: 
#   parameter that describes the change in the mutation probability when drug levels are intermediate
#   - set k=0.5 for a simple linear model where mutation probability decreases linearly with drug concentration
#   - set k=2 or k=4 for a piecewise-linear model where mutation probability increases from high concentrations
#           to intermediate concentrations, and then decreases linearly from intermediate concentrations to zero
