    "# MaSim Country Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "This note book is used for running the country calibration processes for eventual use in the experimental simulation process where various response strategies are modeled. This notebook and the accompanying toolkit was developed by [James Brodovsky](https://github.com/jbrodovsky) and Sarit Adhikari as part of the calibration efforts for Burkino Faso and Mozambique in 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation is in two parts. First, clone this repository to your local machine. Second, install the `masim_analysis` package into a virtual environment, e.g., using `pip` or `uv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using `uv` (and you should!) install via\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the package in an editable mode, allowing you to make changes to the code and have them reflected in your local environment. If for some reason you are not seeing the changes reflected, try re-installing the package locally using the above commands again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, and this should be done only if you are developing additional toolbox features, you can run this notebook from the root (top level) directory and direct import calls to the toolbox via \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from src.masim_analysis import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `*` is the specific module you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package and repo structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make note of the following directory structures: `conf` and `data`. These are the primary two directories for experimental country data and configuration files. The `conf` directory contains the configuration (.yml) files for the simulation, while the `data` directory contains the data files used in the simulation (typically raster `.asc` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these folders is organized by country. For example, if you are working with Mozambique, which we abrieviate as `moz`, the directory structure would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data/\n",
    "    moz/\n",
    "        calibration/\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "conf/\n",
    "    moz/\n",
    "        calibration/\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Additionally the templates folder contains the template files for the configuration files. These are used to generate the .yml files for the simulation. This templating system is gradually being phased out in favor of a more structured approach using Python data classes in the `configure` module. Ultimately, this package communicates with the MaSim simulation through a `.yml` configuration file that can still be created manually if you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Style guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This package follows pretty strict styling guidelines for clarity and consistency. The code is formatted and linted using `ruff` and `pyright`. In particular, `pyright` is configured in standard mode, which means that it will check for type errors and other issues in the code. Warnings and errors reported by either of these tools should be addressed before submitting a pull request. In some cases, this may result in somewhat more verbose code, but it is done to ensure that the code is clear and easy to understand. The goal is to make the code as readable and maintainable as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook should be thought of as a structured interactive prompt that guides you through the process of calibrating and validating a country. The code is generally organized into sections that can be run independently. The notebook breaks up individual workflows by using markdown headings and note blocks. Due to the some what long-running nature of the tasks that calibration and validation involve, you'll sometimes have to wait and shutdown the kernel the notebook is running on and pick up where you left off another time (or wait for them to complete on a cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, this notebook is designed to make things organized but also segmented. Calibration constants (name, population, etc.) are handled through the `CountryParams` dataclass found in `masim_analysis.configure` and the initial setup workflow has you define this and save it to a file. Module and library imports should be handled in the workflow segment you are currently working on. It is recommend (for speed of execution) to separate out imports from code execution to save time on re-importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are generally separated by a horizontal rule and when you reach one, you can consider that segment complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on calibration efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary calibration point is to relate the beta parameter (rate of infection/biting) with the actual reported prevelence, given the population size of a given map pixel and treatment access rate. This involves a few steps. As a preliminary step, obtain the relevant raster files that contain population data, district mapping values, treatment access, and prevalence (pfpr2-10, or a similar name) and place it under `data/<country>`. Fictitious calibration data will be stored under `data/<country>/calibration`. Create a new branch in the git repository for the calibration process. This is important to keep track of changes and to avoid conflicts with the main branch. The main branch should be reserved as a branching off point for strategy and treatment analysis or new calibration efforts. The workflow there should be to branch off from the main branch, implement the strategies and treatments, and then merge back in any useful changes. Strategy and treament analysis shouldn't be a main contribution to the main branch. The calibration branch name should be descriptive and include the country name, e.g., `calibration-moz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration then occurs in two phases and should be done on a separate git branch. The first phase is generating the simulated data for beta calibration. This creates the fictitious configuration and data files. This concludes with several command and job files to be run on a cluster. At the moment this is configured to work on Temple University's OwlsNest cluster, but the resulting `*_cmds.txt` files simply contain a list of shell commands that execute the simulation and should be generalizable to whatever parallel computing cluster system you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second phase is started when the batch processing is completed and downloaded locally to the `output/<country>/calibration` directory. These files are then summarized and the prevalence and beta values are fit using a log-sigmoid curve fit when broken down by pixel population and treatment access rate. These fits are then used to generate the beta map for eventual use in the experimental simulation.\n",

    "## Basic parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few country specific parameters that we need to develop and organize. These parameters are frequently used and are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: The country code name. Usually two or three letters. Examples: `moz` for Mozambique, `bf` for Burkino Faso, `rwa` for Rwanda, `tz` for Tanzania, etc.\n",
    "- `birth_rate`: The birth rate of the country. This is used to calculate the population growth rate. This is usually a constant value for the country. Data is typically given in births per 1000 people. Normalize that data to a decimal value.\n",
    "- `target_population`: The population of the country in the calibration target year.\n",
    "- `initial_age_structure`: The initial age bins of the country. \n",
    "- `age_distribution`: The age distribution of the country as percentages corresponding to the age bins.\n",
    "- `death_rate`: The death rate of the country corresponding to the age bins.\n",
    "- `access_rates`: the treatment access rates for the country. This is determined by the unique values in the raster file typically called `<name>_treatementseeking.asc`\n",
    "- `target_case_count`: The target year case count for the country.\n",
    "- `lower_bound_case_count`: The lower bound of the target year case count for the country.\n",
    "- `upper_bound_case_count`: The upper bound of the target year case count for the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these are configuration parameters that are fed into the `MaSim` simulation. Others are simply descriptive (e.g. `name`) are are used to organize files. It is useful to have these parameters as variables. Once we have gone through the initial tuning, these parameters are stable and it is useful to simply keep them in a Python source file and import them as neccessary."
