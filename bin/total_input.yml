#       e.g. 0.999 means the drug can kill 99.9% of parasites in 1 day if a person has 
#       the highest possible drug concentration
#
# n: 
#       the slope of the linear portion of the conentration-effect curve

#       the actual drug concentration, per individual, will be drawn from a normal distribution with mean=1 and this sd.
#
# k: 
#       parameter that describes the change in the mutation probability when drug levels are intermediate
#       - set k=0.5 for a simple linear model where mutation probablity decreases linearly with drug concentration
#       - set k=2 or k=4 for a piecewise-linear model where mutation probability increases from high concentrations
#               to intermediate concentrations, and then decreases linearly from intermediate concentrations to zero
#

# this is the daily probability that a parasite will mutate at a given locus when the drug concentration is not zero
